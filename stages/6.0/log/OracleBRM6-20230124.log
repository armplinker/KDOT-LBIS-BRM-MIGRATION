Additional changes by Allen R. Marshall, ARM LLC - starting 20220818
===========================================================================================================================================================
ARM LLC Revision History
===========================================================================================================================================================
20220818 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - initial review, added globals to preserve datadict and paramtrs tables for KDOT LBIS 9 (BrM 5.3) database
20221220 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - corrected minor typos as encountered
20221220 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - changed name of global to SAVEAGENCYSYSTABLES, now just 1 global, more changes near line 390 to backup PARAMTRS, DATADICT,PON_COPTIONS, COPTIONS, and KDOTBLP_ATTRIBUTE_DESCRIPTOR explicitly
20221220 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - near line 32,442 declaration for the query string is now V_Q VARCHAR2(2000 CHAR); -- ARMarshall, ARM LLC - 20221220 - error reported string buffer was too small, increased from 300 to 2000
20221220 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - near line 40,604 - failing because MV did not exist due to repeated runs (?) reformatted this MV section and added BEGIN EXCEPTION END blocks around each EXECUTE IMMEDIATE
20221220 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - added option to print cursor detail for debugging purposes - set to 0 normally 
20221227 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - set option DISABLE_FORCE_DEF_BY_TABLE to ON, created table VALIDATION_WARNING externally, modified table PON_APP_USERS_ROLES to add ACTIVE_DIRECTORY_ROLE column  directly
20221227 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - External script Drop_Create_Table_PON_MOBILE_ERRORS.pdc created to create new table PON_MOBILE_ERRORS
20221227 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - External script Drop_Create_Table_VALIDATION_WARNING.pdc created to create new table VALIDATION_WARNING
20221227 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - External script Drop_Create_Dummy_UserTables.pdc created to create dummy USERBRDG and USERINSP tables
20221227 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - As of 20221227, there were no orphan records in USERRWAY or USERSTRUNIT
20221228 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - Script assumes that table PON_PROGRAM has column INCLUDE_WORK_CANDIDATES CHAR(1) DEFAULT ('T')
20230103 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - Script modified to use procedure backup_KDOTBLP_PORTAL_TABLES to backup separately every table listed in KDOTBLP_PORTAL_TABLES with unique name and suffix _KT, added global var KDOT_TABLE_CLEANUP to kill the tables after the run, defaults to 0
20230103 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - Changed object name e.g. TABLE_NAME references from VARCHAR2(30) to VARCHAR2(128 BYTE) throughout
20230103 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - this name length change affects several/many SUBSTR calls - the table names may be as long as 128
20230103 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - EXAMPLE SNIPPET (near line 4860:
 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>> -- Oracle object name used to be 30 
 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>> -- the SUBSTR function here has been changed to permit up to 126 chars of the real name to be used for the _T table 
 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>> -- given that the suffix _T takes up 2 chars. 
 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>     WITH T(TABLE_NAME) AS (SELECT DISTINCT SUBSTR(TABLE_NAME, 1, 126) || '_T' FROM PON_DICT  ] etc.
20230103 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - fixed apparent typo IS_K1EY to IS_KEY in the inserts to DATADICT_T near line 6080
20230103 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - relocated the prerequisite files to repos subdirectory KDOT-LBIS-BRM-MIGRATION/files/scripts/ 
20230105 - ARMarshall,ARM LLC -added/restored NOT NULL constraint to USERRWAY.ON_UNDER and USERSTRUNIT.STRUNITKEY
20230106 - ARMarshall,ARM LLC -added a script Script_Restore_Missing_KDOT_Objects.pdc to restore KDOT objects that get nuked by the upgrade process.  Runs at the end of the upgrade.
20230109 - ARMarshall,ARM LLC -removed redundant backup of KDOT tables.  Now found in PROCEDURE BACKUP_KDOTBLP_PORTAL_TABLES and called from this script with EXEC xxx
