ARM LLC Revision History
==================================================================================================
20220818 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - initial review, added globals to preserve datadict and paramtrs tables for KDOT LBIS 9 (BrM 5.3) database
20221220 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - corrected minor typos as encountered
20221220 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - changed name of global to SAVEAGENCYSYSTABLES, now just 1 global, more changes near line 390 to backup PARAMTRS, DATADICT,PON_COPTIONS, COPTIONS, and KDOTBLP_ATTRIBUTE_DESCRIPTOR explicitly
20221220 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - near line 32,442 declaration for the query string is now V_Q VARCHAR2(2000 CHAR); -- ARMarshall, ARM LLC - 20221220 - error reported string buffer was too small, increased from 300 to 2000
20221220 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - near line 40,604 - failing because MV did not exist due to repeated runs (?) reformatted this MV section and added BEGIN EXCEPTION END blocks around each EXECUTE IMMEDIATE
20221220 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - added option to print cursor detail for debugging purposes - set to 0 normally 
20221227 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - set option DISABLE_FORCE_DEF_BY_TABLE to ON, created table VALIDATION_WARNING externally, modified table PON_APP_USERS_ROLES to add ACTIVE_DIRECTORY_ROLE column  directly
20221227 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - External script Drop_Create_Table_PON_MOBILE_ERRORS.pdc created to create new table PON_MOBILE_ERRORS
20221227 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - External script Drop_Create_Table_VALIDATION_WARNING.pdc created to create new table VALIDATION_WARNING
20221227 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - External script Drop_Create_Dummy_UserTables.pdc created to create dummy USERBRDG and USERINSP tables
20221227 - ARMarshall, ARM LLC - As of 20221227, there were no orphan records in USERRWAY or USERSTRUNIT
